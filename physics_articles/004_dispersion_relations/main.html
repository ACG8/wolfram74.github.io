      Note: This article makes extensive use of sound in the examples, if you'd like to get the full experience, be in a place where it's not rude to have your speakers on, or have headphones available.

      Let's talk about waves. They're really important, both from a research perspective and in your day to day life. You may be familiar with how sound you hear is a pressure wave traveling through air, and the light you see is an electromagnetic wave traveling through space. In fact there are ways to mathematically describe nearly anything as a collection of waves. What do I mean by collection of waves? Well, here's a single sound wave at 440 cycles per second, or hertz.
      $&X = 1*sin(440*t)&$
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id ='440-0' class='audio_control'>
        <span>
          440 hz tone
        </span>
        <input type='button' value='play'>
        <input type='button' value='stop'>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      People with a bit of musical background will know that that is a monotonic note A. People with a bit more musical background will know that an instrument of a given note has multiple tones present simultaneously.
      $&A = \Sigma_{i=1}^7 a_i*sin(i*440*t)&$
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id ='440-all' class='audio_control'>
        <span>
          440 hz note
        </span>
        <input type='button' value='play'>
        <input type='button' value='stop'>
      </div>
    </p>
    <!-- a a+ b c c+ d d+ e -->
    <!-- 0 1  2 3 4  5 6  7  -->
    <p>
      and a chord is made of several rich notes at once.
      $&chord=A+C\#+E=
      \Sigma_{i=1}^7 a_i*sin(i*440*t)
      +\Sigma_{i=1}^7 b_i*sin(i*554*t)
      +\Sigma_{i=1}^7 c_i*sin(i*659*t)&$.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id ='440-all&554-all&659-all' class='audio_control'>
        <span>
          440 hz note major chord
        </span>
        <input type='button' value='play'>
        <input type='button' value='stop'>
      </div>

      Not only are they increasingly complicated mathematically and aurally, but if you were to plot the pressure differences, you'd see the complexity in another way.

      Now you can see there is a complicated structure to any collection of waves that we get information or impressions from. And this structure persists over space! What I mean by that is say we have a guitarist on stage and they strum a chord. Someone in the front row will detect the chord, and quite easily because it will be load, but someone in the nose bleed section will detect <em>the same structure</em>, albeit with less amplitude because it's spread out over the entire sphere of that distance, but there's a special property of sound waves in environments that we're used to that enables that. Which is good, because our voices, every bit of spoken language depends on being the same when heard from a meter away and from a hundred meters away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special property I'm alluding to is that sound waves have a constant group velocity, low notes and high notes propagate at the same speed. What's the big deal, some people who remember there high school physics, might be saying, sound has a speed, light has a speed, that's that. The particularly retentive might even be as bold as to say that that speed is defined as $&v=f*\lambda&$, the product of the frequency and wavelength. They may feel slighted now and maybe even deceived that their teachers gave them a simplified version of the more complicated workings of things. This is however typical in physics and I can only imagine and dearly hope the same to be true in other disciplines for I trust that mitochondria is understood with more sophistication than as the powerhouse of the cell, among other things.

      A more sophisticated treatment of waves reveals that wavelength and frequency can have a very complicated relationship, referred to as the dispersion relation. It's usually written in terms of the angular equivalents of frequency and wavelength, angular frequency and wave number. $&\omega = \Omega(k)&$ or $&D(\omega, k)&$. The wave number is defined as $&k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&$, has units of 1 over length, and it makes trig functions simpler. Equipped with a dispersion relationship we can learn how these shapes spread through their mediums. This is because the group velocity is how fast that happens. It's $&\frac{d\Omega}{dk}&$, when you plot the dispersion relation, the slope of the line is how fast waves with that wavenumber travel. So you might see how in cases where $&\omega = v*k&$ you get out a constant, frequency independent wave like with light and sound as we're used to it. Waves with this constant relation are known as acoustic waves, because they were first observed as sound. Light in a vacuum is another example.

      $&\omega = \sqrt{g*k}&$
      , de broglie waves of mass
      $&\omega = c*k^2&$
      , whistler mode
      $&\frac{a^2k^2}{\omega^2}=1-\frac{\omega_p^2/\omega^2}{1+(\omega_c/\omega)}&$
