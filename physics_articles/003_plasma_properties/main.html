      Plasmas, for the unfamiliar are gases and fluids that have a significant enough amount of charged particles in them that they are heavily impacted by electromagnetic forces. This open ended description allows many, many, <em>many</em> things fall under the purview of plasma physics. Things as cold and tenuous as intergalactic space, things as intense as the cores of stars and centers of nuclear explosions, things as ephemeral as lightening, things as placid as a candle flame. All of those are plasmas. To make any progress at all, one must make some thoughts on how to distinguish those very different kinds, or regimes, of plasma phenomena. When you're starting out thinking about plasmas there are 3 major properties that you deal with and help you to distinguish between kinds of plasmas the way you distinguish solids from gases, $&n&$, $&\tau&$, and $&\vec{B}&$.

    <p>
       $&n&$ is the density of particles, however since you typically have at the very least two different kinds of particles, some negative species (often electrons) and some positive species (atomic ions, like hydrogen or helium), in most mathematical treatments you break up the density into how much of each species you have $&n_s&$ so if you have say, an equal distribution of hydrogen and helium and electrons all hot enough to be stripped of all their electrons and uniformly distributed through out, you would have $&n_0=n_H=n_{He}=\frac{1}{3}n_e&$. Density is measure in quantity per unit volume, such as cubic meters, cubic centimeters, or cubic light years.

      $&\tau&$ is the temperature of the system. In many disciplines, temperatures are talked about in units Kelvin, or maybe Celsius, or heaven forbid Rankine. Then when they want to do actual math with them they multiply them by boltzmann's constant to turn them into some unit of energy, like Joules or Ergs or electron Volts (eV). This is because that's what temperature is, it's an aggregate kinetic energy, a system with twice the temperature will have particles that, on average, have twice the kinetic energy. Now, physicists, being people, are incredibly lazy, and whenever presented the chance will write less. So instead of doing $&k_b*T&$ over and over again, we just write $&\tau&$. <em>This almost never gets confusing when we also use $&\tau&$ as a way to denote time.</em> In addition to why we forgo kelvin often is because often plasmas get hot enough that the numbers get big very quickly, since we're dealing with ionized gasses, the natural temperature scale is on the order of 1-10 eV, because that's how much energy it takes to strip an electron from an atom. 1 eV is over eleven thousand kelvin. While we can still do math on big numbers as thoroughly as we can on small numbers, it is harder to keep in mind relative scale the larger things get. Trying to keep things simple is important, especially when things get intrinsically weirder.

      Lastly of the major properties is $&\vec{B}&$, which is the magnetic field. It's a vector unlike the other two quantities, which are scalars. This means it not only has a magnitude but also a direction. Like the question "what floor is my friends apartment on?" has a scalar answer, ranging from 1 to 163(if they lived in the Burj Khalifa), but "where is my friends apartment from my place?" has a vector answer, because it is not just some number of kilometers away, it's also in a particular direction. The fact that plasmas contain large amounts of charged particles means they are effected by magnetic fields. Primarily by flowing along in the same direction as the field is pointing and spinning around it, so often times we'll talk about properties that are perpendicular and parallel to the field as they are different cases. Velocity for example, another vector, would be tracked as both $&\vec{v}=\vec{v_\parallel}+\vec{v_\perp}&$.
