      Plasmas, for the unfamiliar are gases and fluids that have a significant enough amount of charged particles in them that they are heavily impacted by electromagnetic forces. This open ended description allows many, many, <em>many</em> things fall under the purview of plasma physics. Things as cold and tenuous as intergalactic space, things as intense as the cores of stars and centers of nuclear explosions, things as ephemeral as lightening, things as placid as a candle flame. All of those are plasmas. To make any progress at all, one must make some thoughts on how to distinguish those very different kinds, or regimes, of plasma phenomena. When you're starting out thinking about plasmas there are 3 major properties that you deal with and help you to distinguish between kinds of plasmas the way you distinguish solids from gases, $&n&$, $&\tau&$, and $&\vec{B}&$.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting down to basics.</h3>
    <p>
       $&n&$ is the density of particles, however since you typically have at the very least two different kinds of particles, some negative species (often electrons) and some positive species (atomic ions, like hydrogen or helium), in most mathematical treatments you break up the density into how much of each species you have $&n_s&$ so if you have say, an equal distribution of hydrogen and helium and electrons all hot enough to be stripped of all their electrons and uniformly distributed through out, you would have $&n_0=n_H=n_{He}=\frac{1}{3}n_e&$. Density is measure in quantity per unit volume, such as cubic meters, cubic centimeters, or cubic light years.
    </p>
    <p>
      $&\tau&$ is the temperature of the system. In many disciplines, temperatures are talked about in units Kelvin, or maybe Celsius, or heaven forbid Rankine. Then when they want to do actual math with them they multiply them by boltzmann's constant to turn them into some unit of energy, like Joules or Ergs or electron Volts (eV). This is because that's what temperature is, it's an aggregate kinetic energy, a system with twice the temperature will have particles that, on average, have twice the kinetic energy. Now, physicists, being people, are incredibly lazy, and whenever presented the chance will write less. So instead of doing $&k_b*T&$ over and over again, we just write $&\tau&$. <em>This almost never gets confusing when we also use $&\tau&$ as a way to denote time.</em> In addition to why we forgo kelvin often is because often plasmas get hot enough that the numbers get big very quickly, since we're dealing with ionized gasses, the natural temperature scale is on the order of 1-10 eV, because that's how much energy it takes to strip an electron from an atom. 1 eV is over eleven thousand kelvin. While we can still do math on big numbers as thoroughly as we can on small numbers, it is harder to keep in mind relative scale the larger things get. Trying to keep things simple is important, especially when things get intrinsically weirder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly of the major properties is $&\vec{B}&$, which is the magnetic field. It's a vector unlike the other two quantities, which are scalars. This means it not only has a magnitude but also a direction. Like the question "what floor is my friends apartment on?" has a scalar answer, ranging from 1 to 163(if they lived in the Burj Khalifa), but "where is my friends apartment from my place?" has a vector answer, because it is not just some number of kilometers away, it's also in a particular direction. The fact that plasmas contain large amounts of charged particles means they are effected by magnetic fields. Primarily by flowing along in the same direction as the field is pointing and spinning around it, so often times we'll talk about properties that are perpendicular and parallel to the field as they are different cases. Velocity for example, another vector, would be tracked as both $&\vec{v}=\vec{v_\parallel}+\vec{v_\perp}&$.
    </p>
    <h3>Ion Collision Frequency $&\nu_{ei}&$</h3>
    <p>
      So these are basic properties of plasma systems. What are some characteristics of plasma that we can calculate from them and how do they help us distinguish lightening from a candle flame? Well, let's talk about the first weirdness. Gas particles are constantly moving about, they're tiny so we don't notice the little dots of nitrogen flitting around, but they are. And there's a reasonably large amount of them in the air, so they're constantly bumping into each other. The average distance they travel between bumps is called the mean free path, which is a length, so it's sometimes given the symbol $&l&$ because dang it if we're not an inventive group of people. The mean free path is pretty easy to calculate, if you have the collision frequency $&\nu_c&$. It's just $&l=\frac{v}{\nu_c}&$.
    </p>
      <note>see if font can be changed to improve distinctiveness of nu and v.</note>
    <p>
      Cool, ok, so what's $&\nu_c&$? Well, if we're trying to figure out how often something collides with some set of targets, we think about how big is the target, how many targets are there, and how fast the thing is moving through the targets. Ok, how many is easy, that's just density, particles per volume. How fast the thing is moving through targets is also easy, that's just velocity of our subject, we'll say it's an electron for now. so we're at $&\nu_c=n_t*v_e*area&$, well, how do we calculate area?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a neutral atom, the electron will bounce off it hits it but not really notice before then.

      so we end up with something within an order of magnitude of $&\pi a_0^2&$ where $&a_0&$ is the bohr radius, a piddling tiny distance clocking in at about $&5*10^{-11}&$ meters. Which is a really insignificantly tiny number. For context, if all the information in a reasonable quality copy of the film The Shawshank Redemption(700~ megabytes) represented 1 whole meter, the width of an atom is roughly the first bit, the first 1 or 0 of that movie. So, less than a single pixel of a single frame. Unless the electron is almost moving directly at the atom it's going to do nothing at all in response to it's existence. But that's neutral atoms, plasma's are fun because it's the ions and electrons that are doing the cool stuff, how do ions effect the path of an electron?

      Oh dang, you get some pretty wicked redirections going inside that circle, but even never going near it you can see pretty noticeable bending. What's going on here? Well, one useful way to approach this problem is through thinking about potential energy. The same way a bicycle will want to roll down a hill, an electron will want to "roll" down to an ion. The given height of the hill can be either positive or negative depending on if it's opposite or similar charges and goes like $&\frac{1}{r}&$, so as you get really close, the hill gets incredibly steep. But it never goes quite to zero, even far away. So you can kind of imagine the potential for a charged particle being like the horn of a trombone or cone the flairs out towards the edges. Meanwhile for a neutral particle, a reasonable metaphor would just be a cylinder that goes up forever, nothing's getting any closer than the surface of the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying we know what the electron's initial velocity is, we know it's kinetic energy
      $&KE = \frac{m_e}{2}v_e^2&$
      . We could say that the electron has collided with the ion if it would have passed inside a distance that the potential energy is greater than the kinetic energy. The full expression for potential energy between two charged particles is, within a plus or minus sign,
      $&PE= \frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}&$
      . So when
      $&\frac{PE}{KE}\ge1&$
       we've had a collision. So we'll define a term, radius of collision,
      $&r_c&$
       such that
      $&\frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r_c} \frac{1}{\frac{m_e}{2}v_e^2}  = 1 &$
       which after a bit of algebra and tidying gives us
      $&r_c = \frac{q^2}{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e v_e^2} &$
      . If this looks complicated, that is because it is much more complicated than the simple constant
      $&a_0&$
       we had for neutral collisions, it's an actual function with dependence on something that might change, the electron velocity. But everything else in that expression is basically a constant, so we could capture all of it's behavior by bundling the rest of the constants together
      $&r_c = \frac{k}{v_e^2} &$
      . This'll make other expressions a bit easier to work with and we'll unpack it later. For a bit of context, if the electron has a kinetic energy of 1 eV (moderately warm, but nothing exceptional), $&r_c&$ would be about a hundred times larger than the bohr radius we talked about earlier. So, we have a radius, area is just radius squared times pi,
      $&A_c = \pi r_c^2 = \frac{\pi k^2}{v_e^4}&$
      . Slap that into our collision frequency expression and we get
      $&\nu_c =n_i v_e \frac{\pi k^2}{v_e^4} = \frac{n_i \pi k^2}{v_e^3}&$ which, after this whirlwind of a journey gets us a mean free path of $&l = \frac{v_e}{\nu_c} = v_e  \frac{v_e^3}{n_i \pi k^2} = \frac{v_e^4}{n_i \pi k^2}&$.
    </p>
    <h3>Plasma Frequency $&\omega_p&$</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most important time scales in a plasma is the plasma frequency. Most plasmas are, when you zoom out and squint, neutral. It's when you get close up that there are variations in that neutrality. The reason for it being over all neutral is because electric fields act over infinite distances if there's a net charge, and it will add roaming charges distinctiveness as part of the plasma whole, their kinetic energy adapted to serve the collective. But internally there are fluctuations as waves, like in the surface of a pond change the local height of the water line, that change the local charge density so that pockets of net charge crop up. These kinds of changes happen on the scale of the plasma frequency which is
      $&\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_0e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}}=\sqrt{k_p n_0}&$
      and is derived from one of the most egregious spherical-cow methods I've had the pleasure of following along  so far. It's right up there with assuming stars are cubes to figure out the minimum mass of a black hole, which is a beautiful kind of hilarity in it's own right. The gist of it is we model the plasma as being comprised of two overlapping slabs that interact via electric fields, immobile ions in one slab, light weight electrons in the other. We then pull the electron slab over to the side somewhat so they no longer fully overlap and now there's a positive charge density on one side and negative charge density on the other, this causes attraction, restored overlapping and then overshooting, starting the whole process over again. A bit of calculus produces the result that this process has the frequency above, which we elevate to the position of $&\omega_p&$, it then turns out that this value repeatedly comes up over and over again and it's rather amazing that it can be derived in such a simple way. I've included a little toy below where you can see how frequency changes with density.

      So this provides with two different time scales, one on which electrostatic phenomenon take place, and one on which particle-particle phenomenon take place.
