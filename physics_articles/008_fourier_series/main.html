<!--
  demo description
  the main component will be a graph of a line being plucked in a triangle shape.
  user has control over where it is being plucked on, base is length 1, slide is alpha, 0-1
  string is either displaced such that the string is always some fixed Length L (1.1 or something) or that the net tension is is always constant (some force gamma yhat and the resulting shape.)
  if both situations are easy to calculate, maybe allow the user to explore either case.
  in any regard, the use can control this parameter alpha and see that it changes the shape, but also changes the k-spectrum.
  k-spectrum can be listened to using some of the code from the dispersion relation article, clean up the code a bit though.
  entertain going both ways, too, where you give a slider ranging from 1 to, say, 30 that allows the user to select how much of the k-spectrum to include in reconstructing the original pluck.
