    :project notes:
      objective: alleviate tragedy of the commons break down in social living spaces.
      format: a check list that generates each week a set of tasks to be done for various common areas around the house.
      design parameters:
        periodicity: a 4 week cycle is co-prime with 3 people, so any particularly heavy week for a room eventually gets done by everyone.
        rotations: moving people between rooms so any differences in room difficulty is distributed.
      spaces object:
        contains information about each space and what kind of tasks to do, and how often to do them.
